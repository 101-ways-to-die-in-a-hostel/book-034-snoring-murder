### The Death Location (Specific)
**Where exactly does the death occur?**
Room 2A, an 8-bed mixed dorm on the second floor. Werner is in bed 3, a lower bunk against the wall. Jun-ho is in bed 5, upper bunk across the narrow room. The room is approximately 15x12 feet with barely enough space to walk between bunks. One small window overlooks an alley. AC unit rattles and drips. The room amplifies sound.

- Afternoon: Traffic cacophony, Vietnamese pop music from shops, tourists negotiating
- Night: Karaoke from nearby bars, motorbikes, the constant hum of the city that never fully sleeps
- Unique sounds: The specific rhythm of Hanoi traffic - no one honks in anger, just constant communication beeps. And in the dorm: Werner's snoring at 80+ decibels.

### Smells
- Hostel: Stale air, ineffective cleaning products, many bodies in close quarters, beer from the night before
- Street: Pho broth, incense, motorbike exhaust, rain on hot pavement, fish sauce
- Specific to death location: Body odor, beer breath, the particular smell of a room with poor ventilation and eight sleeping people

### Textures
- Surfaces: Plastic-covered mattresses, peeling paint on walls, smooth tiled floors, sticky wooden bunk frames
- Climate feel: Humidity that makes everything damp, sweat that never dries

### Tastes
- Local food: Pho, banh mi, bun cha, egg coffee, bia hoi (fresh beer)
- Hostel offerings: Basic instant coffee, simple rice breakfast, bottled water

### Visual Details
- Colors: Faded yellow colonial walls, red paper lanterns, green mold creeping in corners, colorful street signs
- Light quality: Fluorescent dorm lighting, golden street lamps at night, grey monsoon light
- Distinctive visuals: The tangle of electrical wires on every street, motorbikes stacked with impossible loads, narrow alleyways packed with life

## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Linh
**Description:** 24-year-old Hanoi local, works here to practice English. Friendly but overwhelmed, can't solve problems that cost money. Has heard noise complaints before but has no power to move guests.
**Role in death:** Oblivious - Jun-ho asked to move rooms, Linh said they were full. She didn't see the desperation in his eyes.

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Ba Mai | Elderly woman who has seen everything, noticed Jun-ho's deterioration |
| Security | None | Owner doesn't believe in it |
| Bar/Kitchen | None | Common room only |
| Owner | Mr. Tran | Absentee owner, only cares about profit margins |

### Staff Knowledge
Staff are aware snoring is a problem in shared dorms but consider it part of hostel life. No one noticed how badly Jun-ho was deteriorating. Ba Mai will tell police she saw "death in his eyes" the day before.

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Transient chaos. Guests come and go constantly. Backpacks piled everywhere. Planning conversations in multiple languages. The smell of sunscreen and exhaustion.

### Night Vibe
Pre-gaming for Old Quarter nightlife, then quiet as people crash hard. Except for Room 2A, where Werner's snoring prevents any real rest.

### Guest Demographics
Mix of:
- Young Western backpackers on Southeast Asia circuit
- Budget-conscious older travelers
- Gap year students
- Occasional business travelers who booked wrong
- Long-term stayers who couldn't afford to leave

### Reputation
3.5 stars on HostelWorld - "You get what you pay for." "Location is unbeatable." "Bring earplugs!!" Several reviews specifically mention snoring problems. One review from 6 months ago: "Nice enough but someone's going to snap in those dorms one day."
