# Victim Profile

## Basic Information

**Full Name:** Werner Hoffmann
**Nickname/Handle:** None - doesn't do social media
**Age:** 58
**Nationality:** German
**Occupation:** Retired mechanical engineer

## Archetype
**Primary:** Veteran Backpacker

**Secondary traits:** Budget-obsessed, oblivious to others, set in his ways, unapologetic about his presence

## The Fatal Flaw
**Core Flaw:** Obliviousness

**How it manifests:**
- Genuinely doesn't realize how loud his snoring is
- Dismisses others' complaints as exaggeration
- Believes his right to sleep trumps others' right to quiet
- Has been traveling like this for 30 years - why would he change now?

**How it kills them:**
His inability to recognize the effect his snoring has on others, combined with his dismissive attitude toward complaints, pushes a fragile person over the edge.

## Physical Appearance
- **Height/Build:** 5'10", barrel-chested, thick neck that contributes to the snoring
- **Hair:** Grey, thinning, perpetually messy from travel
- **Distinguishing features:** Thick-framed glasses, impressive handlebar mustache, beer belly, permanently red nose
- **Typical outfit:** Practical hiking clothes that are 20 years old, sandals with socks (unironically), a fanny pack worn at all times

## Personality

### Positive Traits (that get twisted)
1. Self-sufficiency - becomes unwillingness to accommodate others
2. Frugality - becomes choosing cheap dorms over private rooms despite the snoring

### Negative Traits (that seal their fate)
1. Dismissiveness - leads to ignoring escalating complaints
2. Stubbornness - leads to refusing to change beds or take precautions

### Pet Peeves
- Wasteful spending
- Complainers (ironic)
- Modern travelers who need "amenities"

### Fears
- Running out of money before he finishes his bucket list
- Becoming an "old tourist" instead of a "real traveler"
- His body finally failing him

## Background

### Origin Story
Worked at BMW for 35 years in Munich. Divorced twice, both times partly due to snoring. Children are grown and distant. Started backpacking in his 20s and never stopped, even as his body changed. Retirement is his chance to do the extended trip he always dreamed of.

### Why They Travel
Genuine love of travel developed over decades. Also avoiding the lonely apartment that waits for him in Munich. The road is easier than facing the emptiness at home.

### How They Ended Up at This Hostel
Classic Southeast Asia budget circuit. This hostel in Hanoi had good reviews and was cheap. He's been here three nights, the same three nights his killer hasn't slept.

## Voice & Speech

### Vocabulary
- Uses words like: "in my experience," "back in my day," "young people these days"
- Avoids words like: "sorry," "maybe you're right," "I'll try"
- Catchphrases: "I've been traveling longer than you've been alive," "That's just how I am"

### Speech Pattern
- Heavily German-accented English, grammatically correct but stilted
- Long-winded explanations of obvious things
- Talks about himself and his experiences constantly
- Never really listens to responses

### Internal Monologue Style
Self-satisfied, reminiscing about past travels, dismissive of present company, increasingly focused on physical discomforts of aging.

## Digital Presence

### Social Media
- **Platform of choice:** None - "I don't need that"
- **Follower count:** 0
- **Posting style:** N/A
- **Last post before death:** N/A - his last communication was a postcard to his sister

### Online vs Reality
Doesn't have an online presence. What you see is what you get.

## Relationships

### Family
- Two ex-wives who still don't speak to him
- Two adult children who send occasional texts
- Sister in Munich who worries about him

### Friends
- Former work colleagues he sometimes meets for beers
- "Travel friends" he's made over the years, now scattered globally

### Romantic
- Single, not looking
- The road is his companion now

### At the Hostel
- Friendly in a condescending way
- Gives unsolicited advice to younger travelers
- Completely unaware of the hatred building in his roommates

## The Day They Die

### Morning
Woke up well-rested (as always). Complained at breakfast about how young people can't appreciate a good night's sleep. Planned to visit the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum.

### Their Last Normal Moment
Going to bed after a few beers, saying "Gute Nacht" to the room, completely unaware of the three nights of suffering he's caused.

### Final Thoughts
Confusion as something covers his face. Brief struggle. The realization that this is real. Thinking of Munich, his sister, the travels he'll never finish.

### Last Words
"Was ist..." (What is...) - muffled, never finished
